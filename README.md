## Project Description
Before I learned how to program, I had this paper flip-book game in mind where a world was set in a grid, build by different "boxes" with different rules. Each Box type had its own movement cost and some boxes would refill them, or maybe teleport the player to another page.<br>
Now I've finished university and got my game developer grade. While I'm looking for a game job, I have decided to make this idea a reality, in a 3D cube world, instead of paper.
<br>
<br>
- Steps is set in a 3D cube world where the player moves a small cube on its journey of finding its place in this slightly larger world.<br>
- The player has only a given set of steps it is able to move before respawning back at its save point.<br>
- Blocks may be more difficult to move through, costing different amount of steps to traverse.<br>
- other blocks may give the player temporary buffs, like refill steps, teleport or make a new save spot.<br>
- Some Blocks have unique effects, like Ice, that the player glides on untill it reaches the end of the Ice block line.<br>
- The player may also upgrade its abilities, such as being able to move onto water block, expanding what's possible for the player to reach.<br>
<br>
<br>
This game is in an early stage in a work-in-progress production.<br>
I use this game to further evolve my development skills, with a goal of releasing a version in the future.
