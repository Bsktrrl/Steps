----- TASKS SOON TO BE IMPLEMENTED -----



Movement & Camera bugtesting and fixing:
- Sometimes when rotating 90 degrees and the -90 degrees, in narrow places, the right movement result in forward movement
	- Sometimes, when rotating to the left twice, the player move in the looking direction after moving
	- Almost always when at the edge of something, where not all 4 adjacent blocks can be moved to (maybe blocks isn't updated to "null" when the camera is rotating, so it keeps old blocks when they should have been "null"?


Switches:
- Make interactable Wall-switch


Effect Blocks:
- Add all new Effect-prefabs to a Block when their "Effect Block"-script is attached
	- Moveable
