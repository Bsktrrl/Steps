Switches:
- Make Brass Blocks move when switch is pressed (make a new script that activates the elevator script of a linked block, like "Block_Elevator_Step-on" that needs to be added to a block to activate it when walking on the block. This script (attached on the switch) needs to communicate with the linked elevator, so drag-drop the linked elevator's GameObject into a slot in the Switch-scripts and activate/deactivate it from there when the switch is on/off)
