----- NEXT ON THE LIST -----

--- DON'T PLACE NPC'S NEXT TO THE PLAYER --- (then everything will be fine)


2. New Menu UI
- Change the UI for all menus, so it matches the new assets
	- MainMenu
		- Background Image
	- Settings
	- Wardrobe
		- Make it so that only levels that has been visited (has its stats made in saveData), shows the skin for that level (use "?" for the rest)
	- PauseMenu
	- Dialogue
		- Make the option you are currently on, bigger (increase scale size)
		- Change the script and ExcelTemp to have links to other lines, regardless of option or not
	


3. Intro Camera:
__________________

- Make intro, where camera is focused on Glueplant and zoomes out to the player
- Attach a camera to the Glueplant and make it softTransition to the player


4. FreeRoam Camera:
__________________

Make FreeRoam camera by pressing R1 to roam freely
- Snap back to the player when pressing the button again
   - Perform snapping by transitioning very fast, for a smooth experience


5.
Sound:
__________________

5.1. Ice Gliding and Water Blocks
- Fix so that when icegliding and the player can swim, stop before the water as it was a normal ledge

5.2. Ice glide bug
- Fix ice glide audio bug


6.
Menu navigating errors:
__________________

6.1. Menu Errors
- Moving from option to option, keyboard is laggy (may be when the controller is plugged in, but not used?)

6.2. Overworld Errors
- Fix so that the menu operates as intended when pressing/hovering buttons/regions
- Lock the cursor, so it cannot be used in-game



--- OTHER STUFF


1. PLayerGlideAnimation are set in situations it should not (deactivate it if the player movementState is Still)
2. Make the numbers appear when stopping AND release the movementButton
	- Now it disappear if moving into a deadEndBlock and holding in the movementButton
3. The player isn't performing walking animation after Ascending/Descending/SwiftSwim (when moving away from the block landed on)
	- Also, the darkenBlock isn't activated for blocks 1 block above the player when having Ascending, IF ceilingGrab also is active
	- Cannot Ascend from respawn
4. ColdWater isn't treatingt the camera the same way as Water. It may have something to do with the Haze particle
5. When doing CeilingGrabRotation back to the noraml camera, it is buggy when there is more ceilingBlocks in front/over the player and the camera is looking at the player front
6. Add "MovingBlock"-EffectBlock
7. Falling onto a fallingblock prevents movement




--- FROM TESTBONANZA



6. Fences on fallingBlocks immobilizes movement
7. Falling block let the player move down when respawned
8. "Freemove" camera with right joystick

12. Sometimes when rotating 90 degrees and the -90 degrees, in narrow places, the right movement result in forward movement
	- Sometimes, when rotating to the left twice, the player move in the looking direction after moving
	- Almost always when at the edge of something, where not all 4 adjacent blocks can be moved to (maybe blocks isn't updated to "null" when the camera is rotating, so it keeps old blocks when they should have been "null"?

16. Stairs isn't counted for when ascending/Descending
17. Move EffectBlocks on top of SnowBlocks

20. The left movement sometimes run on auto
21. DialogueSegments need to have another option for link when there are no options, but the link cannot be the next line (Change in Excel Sheet)
22. Camera Zoomes far in to the player on stairs, even if it's clear sight
23. Disable camera zoom when rotating the camera (The result isn't that great, try slower zoomtime during rotation)
24. Skins in levels make cameras zoom (in and out, based on the rotation of the skin)
