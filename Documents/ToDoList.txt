--- FROM TESTBONANZA


2. Swiftswim doesn't always work upwards



6. Fences on fallingBlocks immobilizes movement
7. Falling block let the player move down when respawned
8. "Freemove" camera with right joystick



12. Sometimes when rotating 90 degrees and the -90 degrees, in narrow places, the right movement result in forward movement
	- Sometimes, when rotating to the left twice, the player move in the looking direction after moving
	- Almost always when at the edge of something, where not all 4 adjacent blocks can be moved to (maybe blocks isn't updated to "null" when the camera is rotating, so it keeps old blocks when they should have been "null"?




16. Stairs isn't counted for when ascending/Descending
17. Move EffectBlocks on top of SnowBlocks

19. BackButton in Overworld goes back to mainMenu, not the start of Overworld menu
20. The left movement sometimes run on auto
21. DialogueSegments need to have another option for link when there are no options, but the link cannot be the next line (Change in Excel Sheet)
22. Camera Zoomes far in to the player on stairs, even if it's clear sight
23. Disable camera zoom when rotating the camera (The result isn't that great, try slower zoomtime during rotation)
24. Skins make cameras zoom
